# Fable.Lit

Fable.Lit is a collection of tools to help you write [Fable](https://fable.io/) apps by embedding HTML code into your F# code with the power of [lit-html](https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/). Thanks to this, you can use HTML from a designer or a [component library](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/) right away, without any kind of conversion to F#. And if you're using VS Code and install the [Highlight HTML/SQL templates in F#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alfonsogarciacaro.vscode-template-fsharp-highlight) extension the integration will be even smoother:
